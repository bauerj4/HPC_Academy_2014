Mathematical drawing project.

Contents:

*.ps files are Adobe PostScript files which contain drawings of mathematical patterns.
These are generated by C code which converts mathematical equation evaluations into the
aforementioned drawings.  Our code contains files which execute dynamic time stepping 
for the efficiency of generating complicated fractal shapes.  The spirograph and dragon
curve structures are among the most complicated of these, and make dynamic stepping 
very necessary.
